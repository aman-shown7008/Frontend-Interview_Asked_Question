Q. What is JavaScript and why we use it? 
A. JavaScript is a Synchronous single-threaded language everything in JavaScript happens inside a Excution Context.
•  Single threaded means- JavaScript can execute once command at a time.
•  Synchronous single-threaded means- JavaScript can execute one command at a time in a specific order.
   Uses-
   JavaScript is used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It enables developers to create engaging user experiences by responding to user actions in real-time.

   Code-
   function sayHello() {
     console.log('Hello');
   }
   sayHello();

   🖼️Visualization: Call Stack & Execution Contexts:
   🔄Step-by-step:
   1.Program starts
   ✅Create Global Execution Context (GEC)
   ✅Push it to the Call Stack
   Call Stack:
   ┌────────────┐
   │   Global   │
   └────────────┘

   2.JS finds sayHello() call
   ✅Create a new Function Execution Context (FEC) for sayHello()
   ✅Push it on top of the stack.
   Call Stack:
   ┌────────────┐
   │ sayHello() │  ← Active context
   ├────────────┤
   │   Global   │
   └────────────┘

   3.Function finishes
   ✅Pop sayHello() execution context from the stack
   Call Stack:
   ┌────────────┐
   │   Global   │  ← Back to GEC
   └────────────┘

   4.Program ends
   ✅Pop Global Context
   ✅Call Stack is now empty
   Call Stack:
   [ empty ]
   🔹The Global Execution Context is created first, and it always stays at the bottom of the Call Stack.
   🔹Every function call creates a new Execution Context, which gets pushed onto the stack.
   🔹Once a function finishes, its context is popped off.
   🔹Only one context runs at a time — the one at the top of the stack.
   🔹Excution Context contains two things- Memory || Variable Enviroment, Code Enviroment || Thread of Excution. 
   🔹Call Stack maintain order of excution of excution contexts.
      1️⃣Memory / Variable Environment - Stores: Variables, Function declarations, Arguments.
                                        Created during the Creation Phase.
                                        Handles hoisting.
      2️⃣Code Environment / Thread of Execution - Executes code line by line.
                                                  Happens in the Execution Phase.
                                                  Uses values from memory to run logic.


Q. What is Event loop? Uses.
A. Continuously checks whether the Call Stack is empty, and if so, pushes tasks from the Microtask Queue (Promises) and then the Callback Queue (setTimeout, fetch, etc.) into the Call Stack for execution.
   JavaScript is synchronous and single-threaded, but the Event Loop is the mechanism that enables asynchronous behavior like:
   🔹setTimeout, setInterval
   🔹Promises (.then, async/await)
   🔹Event listeners (like click, keydown)
   🔹fetch() and other browser/web APIs
   The Problem
   🔹JS alone can only do one thing at a time. So how does it handle delays, async calls, UI responsiveness, etc.?
   🔹The Solution: Event Loop + Web APIs + Callback Queue (Task Queue) + Microtask Queue.

    🧠 JavaScript Runtime Environment Includes:
    Call Stack – Where Execution Contexts are pushed/popped.
    Web APIs (by browser) – Handles setTimeout, DOM events, AJAX, etc.
    Callback (Task) Queue – Queues async callbacks like from setTimeout, click, etc.
    Microtask Queue – Queues callbacks from Promises (.then, catch, finally), and MutationObserver.

    Event-Loop Working-
    The Event Loop constantly monitors:
    If the Call Stack is empty
    And if there’s anything in the Microtask Queue or Callback Queue
    Execution order:
    Run any code in the Call Stack (synchronous)
    If the stack is empty:
    First, process all tasks in the Microtask Queue
    Then, take the first task from the Callback Queue and push it to the Call Stack
    Microtask Queue Has Higher Priority than Callback Queue
    Ex - console.log("Start");
         setTimeout(() => {
           console.log("Timeout callback");
         }, 0);
         Promise.resolve().then(() => {
           console.log("Promise microtask");
         });
         console.log("End");
    Output - 
    Start
    End
    Promise microtask
    Timeout callback

    Internal Working- 
    🔹console.log("Start") → synchronous → runs immediately
    🔹setTimeout → callback goes to Callback Queue (after 0 ms)
    🔹Promise.then → callback goes to Microtask Queue
    🔹console.log("End") → synchronous → runs immediately
    🔹Event Loop checks: stack is empty → runs Microtask (Promise)
    🔹After Microtasks, then Callback Queue (setTimeout)

    If async code is not present then.
    The Call Stack handles everything.
    The Event Loop doesn't need to fetch anything from the queues.
    The Event Loop is still there, but it's idle, doing nothing extra.
    So: The Event Loop doesn't do anything special unless asynchronous tasks are present. But it’s always watching the Call Stack.

    Real-world Analogy:
    🔹The Call Stack is a chef.
    🔹The Event Loop is the manager who checks if the chef is free.
    🔹The Queues (microtasks and callbacks) are orders waiting to be cooked.
    If there are no async orders, the chef cooks everything directly (sync functions), and the manager (Event Loop) just watches.
    But when an async order (like a delivery) is placed, the manager steps in to bring it at the right time.



Q. How JavaScript Code is executed?
A. When JavaScript code is executed, Execution Context is created and it is called Global Execution Context.
2. JavaScript program is executed in TWO PHASES inside Execution Context - 
   a. MEMORY ALLOCATION PHASE - JavaScript program goes throughout the program and allocate memory of Variables and Functions declared in program.
   b. CODE EXECUTION PHASE -  JavaScript program now goes throughout the code line by line and execute the code. 
3. A Function is invoked when it is called and it acts as another MINI PROGRAM and creates its own Execution Context.
4. Returns keyword return the Control back to the PREVIOUS Execution-Context where the Function is called and Execution Context of the Function is DELETED.
5. CALL STACK maintains the ORDER of execution of Execution Contexts. It CREATES Execution Context whenever a Program starts or a Function is invoked and it pops out the Execution Context when a Function or Program ENDS.



Q. What is Hoisting? Use of it.
A. Mechanism in JS where the variable declarations are moved to the top of the scope before execution. Therefore it is possible to call a function before initializing it.
•  Function Declarations: Hoisting allows you to use a function before it's declared in the code. This is particularly useful when you define functions at the bottom of your script but want to use them at the top.
•  Variable Declarations: Similarly, hoisting allows you to reference variables before they are declared. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations. This means the variable exists but is undefined until it's assigned a value.
•  In JS, before the code is executed, the variables get initialized to undefined.
•  Arrow functions enact as variables and get "undefined" during the memory creation phase while functions actually get run.
•  Whenever a JS program is run, a global execution block is created, which comprises of 2: Memory creation and Code execution.
   Ex - hello();
        function hello(){
          console.log("Hello my Boy");
         }
         console.log(a);
         var a = 5;
   Uses - 
   During the Memory Creation Phase, JS prepares variable/function space in memory, so:
   🔹It knows what exists (var, function)
   🔹Even before actual code runs
   🔹Helps avoid some runtime crashes




Q. What is Call Stack? And its uses?
A. The call stack in JavaScript is a mechanism that keeps track of where the program is in its execution. It operates on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last function that's called is the first one to finish and be removed from the stack.

   Uses of the call stack:
1. Function Call Management: When a function is called, a new Excution context is pushed into the call stack. This Excution context includes the function's arguments and local variables.
2. Execution Order: JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one piece of code at a time. The call stack ensures that function calls are executed in the correct order, and functions return in the opposite order they were called.
3. Error Handling: If an error occurs during execution, the call stack helps trace where the error happened. It shows the sequence of function calls leading up to the error, aiding in debugging.



Q. How functions work and excuted in JavaScript?
A. 1. We learnt how functions work in JS.
2. At first a global execution context is created, which consists of Memory and code and has 2 phases: Memory allocation phase and code execution phase.
3. In the first phase, the variables are assigned "undefined" while functions have their own code.
4. Whenever there is a function declaration in the code, a separate local execution context gets created having its own phases and is pushed into the call stack.
5. Once the function ends, the EC is removed from the call stack.
6. When the program ends, even the global EC is pulled out of the call stack.



Q. What is difference between undefined, not defined & null in JS?
A. Undefined - is a Special Placeholder which is used to reserve memory for the variables in the memory creation phase. Even before a single line of code is executed JS engine assigns undefined to the variables.
   Ex - var x;
        console.log(x); // Output: undefined

   Not Defined means - If we try to console or access any variable which is not declared in the code then we get Not Defined error.
   Ex - // Not defined variable
        console.log(y); // Output: ReferenceError: y is not defined

  Null - Explicitly assigned absence of a value. A variable/object property is intentionally set to null.
  Ex- let data = null;
      console.log(data); // null



Q. What is Scope Chain, Scope & Lexical Environment? And how they work in JS engine?
A. 1. Scope of a variable is directly dependent on the lexical environment.
2. Whenever an execution context is created, a lexical environment is created. Lexical environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent. Lexical as a term means in hierarchy or in sequence.
3. Having the reference of parent's lexical environment means, the child or the local function can access all the variables and functions defined in the memory space of its lexical parent.
4. The JS engine first searches for a variable in the current local memory space, if its not found here it searches for the variable in the lexical environment of its parent, and if its still not found, then it searches that variable in the subsequent lexical environments, and the sequence goes on until the variable is found in some lexical environment or the lexical environment becomes NULL.
5. The mechanism of searching variables in the subsequent lexical environments is known as Scope Chain. If a variable is not found anywhere, then we say that the variable is not present in the scope chain.


Q. What is block and block scope in JS? Use of it.
A. 1. Code inside curly bracket is called block.
2. Multiple statements are grouped inside a block so it can be written where JS expects single statements like in if, else, loop, function etc.
3. Block values are stored inside separate memory than global. They are stored in block. (the reason let and const are called block scope)
4. Shadowing of variables using var, let and const.
5. The shadow should not cross the scope of original otherwise it will give error.
6. shadowing let with var is illegal shadowing and gives error.
7. var value is stored in nearest outer function or global scope and hence can be accessed outside block as well whereas same is not the case with let and const.



Q. Tell me difference b/w var, let and const?
A. Var -
•  We can get value of [ var a = 9 ] before intialization of value becz its value is stores in Global EC.
   console.log(a); //undefined
   var a = 9;
•  We can create same variable name with different intialization value and it will give last intialised.
   var a = 7;
   var a = 9; 
   console.log(a); // Output 9 [ Value stores Globally ]
•  We can also access var if we have intialised value in a block scope.
   {
      var a = 9;
   }
   console.log(a); // Output 9 [ Value stores Globally ]

2. Let - 
•  We can not get value before intialization of it becz value stores at separete memory in Script.
   console.log(a); // Output [ Uncaught ReferenceError: cannot access 'a' before intialization. ]
   let a = 9;
•  We can not redeclare a value with the same name.
   let a = 9;
   let a;
   a = 8;
   console.log(a); //Output [ Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared. ]
•  When we declare a value in block scope. So we can not access it becz value stores at separete memory in block.
   {
       let a = 8;
   }
   console.log(a); //Output [ Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined ]

3. Const - 
•  We can not get value before intialization of it becz value stores at separete memory in Script.
   console.log(a); // Output [ Uncaught ReferenceError: cannot access 'a' before intialization. ]
   const a = 9;
•  We have to intialize value in same line where we have decalared a value and we can not redeclare a value with same name.
   const a;
   a = 8;
   console.log(a); //Output [ Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. ]
•  When we declare a value in block scope. So we can not access it becz value stores at separete memory in block.
   {
       const a = 8;
   }
   console.log(a); //Output [ Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined ]

•  Important Scenario - 
1. let and const are hoisted but its memory is allocated at other place than window which cannot be accessed before initialisation.
2. Temporal Dead Zone exists until variable is declared and assigned a value.
3. window.variable OR this.variable will not give value of variable defined using let or const.
4. We cannot redeclare the same variable with let/const(even with using var the second time).
5. const variable declaration and initialisation must be done on the same line.
6. There are three types of error: [1] referenceError {given where variable does not have memory allocation} [2] typeError {given when we change type that is not supposed to be changed} [3] syntaxError {when proper syntax(way of writing a statement) is not used}.
7. Use const wherever possible followed by let, Use var as little as possible(only if you have to). It helps avoid error.
8. Initialising variables at the top is good idea, helps shrinks TDZ to zero.
9. Whenever we declare any variable inside function so that variable is stored in local memory space.


Q. What is Closures setTimeout?
A. Function bundled with its lexical environment is known as a closure. Whenever function is returned, even if its vanished in execution context but still it remembers the reference it was pointing to.
   Its not just that function alone it returns but the entire closure and that's where it becomes interesting.
1. An inner function can be directly called using two parenthesis ()().
2. Even parameters can be passed this way (Remember that the function needs to be returned to do this)
3. Closures can also be used for data hiding and encapsulation. So other code cannot access this value.
4. Unused variables are automatically deleted in High Level Programming language by garbage collector. Closures allocate a lot of memory which cannot be deleted so this acts as a disadvantage.
5. Some browsers now have smart garbage collectors that automatically deletes variables that are not used outside closures.
6. setTimeout stores the function in a different place and attached a timer to it, when the timer is finished it rejoins the call stack and executed.
7. Without closure the var reference gives the latest value as it does not retain the original value but rather has the reference so any update in value after timeout will be shown.
8. If we use let/const because they have block scope, every time a new copy of variable is attached, thus this can be done without closure.
Ex- function outer(){
     let idx = 1;
     function inner(){
        idx++;
        console.log(idx);
     }
     return inner;
    }
    const count = outer();
    count();
    count();



Q. What are the different types of functions in JavaScript?
A. ✅1. Function Statement (Function Declaration) - A regular named function that supports hoisting.
   Ex - function xyz() {
         console.log("Function Statement");
         }

   ✅2. Function Expression - A function assigned to a variable. Not hoisted (acts like a variable).
   Ex - const a = function () {
          console.log("Function Expression");
        };

   ✅3. Anonymous Function - A function without a name. Used where functions are treated as values (e.g., callbacks).
   Ex - function () {
           // Invalid alone, must be used as a value
         }

   ✅4. Named Function Expression - A function with a name assigned to a variable. Name is accessible only inside the function.
   Ex - const a = function xyz() {
           console.log("Named Function Expression");
        };

   ✅5. Parameters - When we creating a function  & put some variabels in this ( ) that is our Parameters.
   Ex - function ab( param1, param2 ){
          console.log(param1);
        }

   ✅6. Arguments - When we call this function & pass a variabel in this ( ) that is our Arguments
   Ex - ab( 4, 5 );

   ✅7. Function are heart of JS. They are called first class citizens or first class functions because they have the ability to be stored in the variables, passed as parameters and arguments.
   They can also be returned in the function.



Q. What is Asynchronous JavaScript, EVENT LOOP? & What happens when our function goes into Call stack.
A. Call Stack is present inside JS engine.
   1. Browser has superpowers that are lent to JS engine to execute some tasks, these superpowers include web API's such as console, location, DOM API, setTimeout, fetch, local storage.
   2. Callback functions and event handers are first stored in Web API environment and then transferred to callback queue.
   3. Promises and mutation observer are stored in API environment and then transferred to microtask queue.
   4. Event loop continuously observes call stack and when it is empty it transfers task to call stack.
   5. Micro task is given priority over callback tasks.
   6. Too many micro tasks generated can cause Starvation (nit giving time to callback tasks to execute).



Q.  What is d/f b/w Normal Named function and Immediate Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)? Uses.
A.  1. Normal Named Function - 
    A normal named function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It is declared with a name and can be invoked (called) multiple times anywhere in the program.
    Key-Points:
    🔹Defined using the function keyword with a name
    🔹Can be called/reused multiple times
    🔹Can be stored globally or locally
    🔹Helpful for modular, readable code
    Ex - function addToCart(productId) {
            console.log(`Product ${productId} added to cart`);
         }
    ✅Use Cases:
    addToCart(productId)
    applyCoupon(code)
    calculateTotal(items)
    filterProducts(category)
    validateForm(data)
    🗣️ Why? Because these actions are needed multiple times by user interactions — clicks, typing, etc.

    2. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) - 
    An IIFE is a function in JavaScript that is executed immediately after it is defined. It’s typically anonymous and is used to create a private scope or execute setup code once, without polluting the global namespace.
    Key-Points:
   🔹Declared and executed immediately
   🔹Cannot be reused (unless wrapped again)
   🔹Great for data privacy and isolation
   🔹Prevents global variable pollution
   🔹Mostly used for initializations, modules, and one-time setup logic.
   Ex - (function() {
          var config = {
            apiKey: "SECRET_KEY",
            currency: "INR"
          };
          console.log("🛍️ E-commerce App Initialized");
          // Fetch categories, setup filters, initialize cart
        })();
    ✅Use Cases:
    Initialize default filter values
    Setup and protect API keys/config
    Encapsulate setup logic
    Create private modules (pre-ES6)
    Run analytics or tracking on page load

    

Q. What is Callback Function?
A. 1. A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
   2. setTimeout helps turn JS which is singlethreaded and synchronous into asynchronous.
   3. Event listeners can also invoke closures with scope.
   4. Event listeners consume a lot of memory which can potentially slow down the website therefore it is good practice to remove if it is not used.
   Uses - 
   JavaScript is synchronous and single-threaded, which means it executes one line at a time. But for tasks like:
   🔹Delayed execution (setTimeout, setInterval)
   🔹API calls
   🔹File reading
   🔹Event handling (like onclick)
    Ex - document.getElementById('btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
            console.log("Button Clicked!");
          });
    You're saying:
    "Hey browser, when this event (a click) happens in the future, please call this function."
    The function doesn't run at the time of writing, but is registered in the browser’s event system.

   ...you don't want to block the main thread, so callbacks help by allowing certain tasks to run asynchronously.
   Ex - setTimeout(() => {
          console.log("Executed after 5 seconds");
        }, 5000);
        function first(inner) {
           console.log("FIRST");
           inner(); // This is the callback execution
        }
        function inner() {
          console.log("INNER");
        }
        first(inner); 



Q.  What is Callback Hell & Inversion of control? Why it is problem.
A.  Callback Hell - It happens when we write many nested callback functions — that is, one function is passed inside another, which is again passed into another, and so on.
    This creates a structure that looks like a pyramid or staircase, making the code messy and hard to understand or manage.
    Ex - const cart = ["shoes", "pants", "kurtas"];
         api.createOrder(cart, function () {
             api.proceedPayment(function () {
                 api.showSummary(function () {
                     api.updateWallet(function () {
                         console.log("Callback Hell");
                     });
                 });
             });
         });
    Why it’s a problem:
    🔹Code becomes difficult to read and maintain.
    🔹It’s hard to debug or trace errors.
    🔹Each function depends on the previous one, so it becomes very fragile if any one of them fails.

    Inversion of Control - It means giving the control of your code to someone else — like passing a callback function to an API or another function.
    You don’t know when, how, or even if that function will be called, which can lead to unpredictable behavior.
    Ex: Let’s say you’re building a shopping app:
    You first Create Order
    🔹Then do Payment
    🔹Then show Order Summary
    🔹Finally, Update Wallet
    Now, if you pass the Order Summary function inside the Payment function (as a callback), you're trusting a few things:
    That payment() will run correctly
    That it will call the Order Summary function at the right time
    That there are no errors from the backend or network
    But if something goes wrong inside payment(), your Order Summary function might never get called. This means you lose control over what happens next 



Q.  What is Promises? Use-case.
A.  A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
    🔄Three States of a Promise:
    State	          |                  Description                                          |       Real-Life Example   
    🔹Fulfilled	    |        The operation completed successfully.                          |       You got your food.
    🔹Rejected	       |        The operation failed with an error.                            |       Delivery boy canceled.
    🔹Pending	       |        The initial state. The result is not yet available.            |       Food is being prepared  
    Ex - let myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            // async operation
          });

    🔄Methods of a Promise to show Data.
    Method              |                   Purpose                                            |                                     Real-Life Example   
    🔹.then()          |        Executes when Promise is fulfilled (success).                 |      Let’s say you're building an e-commerce site. You fetch product data. - .then() is where you show the data in UI.
    🔹.catch()         |        Executes when Promise is rejected (error).                    |      .catch() is where you show a toast or error screen if the API fails.
    🔹.finally()       |        Executes regardless of success or failure (cleanup).          |      When you fetch something, you usually show a loading spinner. - You ALWAYS want to hide loader – that's the job of .finally().
    Ex - fetchData(){
           .then(showData)
           .catch(showError)
           .finally(() => {
              hideLoader(); // Always runs
           });
         }

    Promise Chaining - Promise chaining is a way to run multiple asynchronous tasks one after another, where each task waits for the previous one to finish.
                       We do this by returning a value (or another promise) from one .then() and calling another .then() after it.
    Example from a video processing app:
    🔹Upload video
    🔹Extract audio
    🔹Get captions
    Show on screen
    Ex - uploadVideo(file)
         .then(extractAudio)
         .then(generateCaptions)
         .then(showCaptions)
         .catch(showError)
         .finally(hideLoader);

    Promise.all() - Used to run multiple Promises in parallel, and wait for all to finish. If any one fails, the whole Promise.all fails.
    Example in E-commerce:
    You want to show:
    🔹Product Details
    🔹Similar Products
    🔹Reviews
    Ex - Promise.all([
           fetch("/api/product/123"),
           fetch("/api/similar/123"),
           fetch("/api/reviews/123")
         ])
         .then(([product, similar, reviews]) => {
           showProduct(product);
           showSimilar(similar);
           showReviews(reviews);
         })
        .catch((err) => {
           showError("Some data failed to load");
        });



Q.  What is Async/Await? Use-Case.
A.  async and await are modern JavaScript keywords that make working with Promises easier and more readable. 
    They were introduced in ES2017 (ES8) to simplify asynchronous code by writing it in a synchronous style, improving code clarity, maintainability, and debugging.

    1. async Keyword - 
    🔹The async keyword is used before a function declaration to tell JavaScript that the function will return a Promise, even if it looks like regular synchronous code.
    🔹Any value returned from an async function is implicitly wrapped in a Promise.
    Ex - async function fetchData() {
            return "data"; // returns a Promise that resolves to "data"
         }
    2. await Keyword - 
    🔹await can only be used inside an async function.
    🔹It tells JavaScript to pause execution of the function until the awaited Promise resolves or rejects.
    🔹This allows writing code that looks synchronous, but is actually asynchronous.
    🔹await only blocks inside the async function where it's used. It does NOT block code that is outside that async function.


    Ex - async function fetchData() {
           const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
           const data = await response.json();
           console.log(data);
         }

    Why Use Async/Await Over Promises (.then/.catch)?
    Feature                |             Promises (.then)                    |             Async/Await
    🔹Readability         |      Can get nested and hard to follow          |      Looks like synchronous code
    🔹Error Handling      |      Requires .catch() or nested .then          |      Use try...catch just like sync code
    🔹Debugging           |      Stack traces can be messy                  |      Cleaner stack traces and better breakpoints
    🔹Flow Control        |      Chained .then()                            |      Top-down execution flow

    Real-World Use-Cases of Async/Await-
    APIs / Fetching Data from Backend.
    Authentication (Login/Register).
    File Uploads or Cloud Services (AWS, Cloudinary).

    Key-points:
    🔹async/await: You say, "Hey, I'm going to cook 3 dishes, one after another, but I’ll write it cleanly so others can understand what I did."
    🔹Promise.all(): You say, "Let’s cook all 3 dishes at the same time using different chefs (parallel execution)."
    🔹Async functions run like normal functions and enter the Call Stack when called.
    🔹When the engine hits an await, it pauses the function and removes it from the Call Stack — it doesn’t block other code.
    🔹The rest of the function is moved to the Microtask Queue, waiting for the awaited Promise to resolve.
    🔹Once resolved, the function is resumed from where it paused, and added back to the Call Stack to finish execution.
