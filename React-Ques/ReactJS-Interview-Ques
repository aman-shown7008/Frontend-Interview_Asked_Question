1.  What is Strict mode in react ?
A.  StrictMode is a wrapper component in React that helps developers identify potential problems in their applications during development. It does not render anything in the UI but activates additional checks and warnings.

    Use / Purpose-
    ðŸ”¹Detects unsafe lifecycle methods.
    ðŸ”¹Warns about usage of deprecated APIs.
    ðŸ”¹Helps find side effects in components (like double rendering).
    ðŸ”¹Ensures best practices are followed for future React versions.

    StrictMode runs only in development, not in production.
    Itâ€™s safe â€” it wonâ€™t break your app, just gives warnings.
    Recommended to always use it at the root level of your React app.

    Warning that he warns-
    ðŸ”¹Double Rendering (Development Only).
    ðŸ”¹Unsafe Lifecycle Methods (in class components).
    ðŸ”¹Warns if you use old React features that will be removed.
    ðŸ”¹All useEffect, useLayoutEffect, and useInsertionEffect hooks are executed twice in development.
    ðŸ”¹Helps identify impure rendering logic (like modifying variables, doing API calls directly in render).

    ðŸ‘‰React StrictMode is a development-only tool to highlight potential problems (deprecated APIs, side effects, unsafe lifecycles) and enforce best practices.
