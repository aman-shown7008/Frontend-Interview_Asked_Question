Basics-
🔹 To Install - npm install -g typescript
🔹 Check Version - tsc -v



1.  What is TypeScript & Use-case?
A.  TypeScript adds extra rules to JavaScript that help your code work better with your code editor. It helps find mistakes before you even run the code.
    TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js, Deno, Bun and in your apps.

    Use-Case:
🔹 Type Safety – Prevents bugs by enforcing types.
🔹 Better Code Suggestions (Autocompletion) – Helps with better IntelliSense in VS Code.
🔹 Improved Readability & Maintainability – Code is easier to understand in teams.
🔹 Works with React, Node.js, and other JS frameworks – No extra effort needed.
   



2.  Difference between JavaScript and TypeScript?
A.  Feature	                                       JavaScript (JS)                                                                            	  TypeScript (TS)
    Definition-	                   A dynamic, loosely-typed scripting language used for web development.	                     A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing for better code quality.
    Typing-                        Dynamically typed (no type checking).	                                                     Statically typed (checks types at compile time).
    Compilation-         	       No compilation needed, directly runs in browsers.	                                         Needs to be compiled (tsc converts .ts to .js).
    Error Detection-	           Errors are found at runtime.	                                                                 Errors are found at compile time, preventing bugs early.
    OOP Support-	               Supports OOP but lacks built-in interfaces and strong typing.	                             Supports interfaces, generics, and advanced OOP concepts.
    Browser Support-	           Directly supported by browsers.	                                                             Needs to be transpiled to JavaScript before running in browsers.
    Code Readability-	           Less structured due to lack of types.	                                                     More structured with types, making large projects easier to manage.
    Community Support-	           Huge community, widely used.	                                                                 Growing fast, preferred in large projects.



Q.  What are the Core Data types in TS? With Use-Case.
A.  1️⃣Number - Represents all numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
    Ex - let age: number = 10;
         let binary: number = 0b1010;
    🔹Use Case: Used for calculations, counters, prices, etc.

    2️⃣String - Represents text values.
    Ex - let fName: string = "Aman";
         let greeting: string = `Hello {fName}!`;
    🔹Use Case: Used for storing and manipulating text.

    3️⃣Boolean - Represents true or false values.
    Ex - let isLogged: boolean = true;
         let hasPermision: boolean = false;
    🔹Use Case: Used for conditions, toggles, and authentication logic.

    4️⃣Array - Represents a collection of elements of a specific type.
    Ex - let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        let names: Array<string> = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];
   🔹Use Case: Used for storing lists, collections, and iterations.

    5️⃣Tuple - Represents a fixed-length array with different types.
    Ex - let person: [string, number] = ["Alice", 30];
    🔹Use Case: Used for structured data like database records.

    6️⃣Enum - Represents a set of named constants.
    Ex - enum Color { Red, Green, Blue } 
         let myColor: Color = Color.Green;
   🔹Use Case: Used for defining a set of related constants like status codes or modes.

    7️⃣Any - Allows any type of value, disabling type checking.
    Ex - let data : any = "Hello";
         data = 42;
    🔹Use Case: Used when migrating JavaScript code or handling dynamic values.

    8️⃣Unknown - Similar to any, but type checking is enforced before usage.
    Ex - let userInput: unknown;
         userInput = "Hello";
         userInput = 42;

         if(typeof userInput === "String"){
            console.log(userInput.toUpperCase());
         }
    🔹Use Case: Used for safe dynamic values where the type is initially unknown.

    9️⃣Void - Used for functions that do not return a value.
    Ex - function logMess(): void{
           console.log("Logging...");
         }
    🔹Use Case: Used for functions that perform side effects like logging.

    🔟Null & Undefined - Represents absence of value.
    Ex - let nothing: null = null;
         let notAssigned: undefined = undefined;
    🔹Use Case: Used when a value is explicitly missing.

    1️⃣1️⃣Never - Represents functions that never return or always throw an error.
    Ex - function throwError(message: string): never {
            throw new Error(message);
         }
    🔹Use Case: Used for error handling and infinite loops.
