1.  What is React-Flow? Uses.
A.  React Flow is a JavaScript library made for building interactive diagrams and flow-based editors in React apps.
    Instead of drawing lines and boxes yourself, React Flow makes it super easy — it manages nodes, edges (connections), dragging, zooming, etc. for you.
    Uses-
    ✅To make flowcharts
    ✅To build node-based editors (example: data flow editors, AI pipelines)
    ✅To create custom dashboards with diagrams
    ✅To allow users to drag, connect, and rearrange blocks easily
    ✅To build no-code/low-code tools (like Zapier, Webflow logic builder)
    Any time you want users to build something with "blocks" and "connections" visually, React Flow is a great choice.
    React Flow can be used to show the working or flow of a website visually using nodes and edges (boxes and arrows).
    A new user who comes to your ecommerce website (and maybe feels confused) can look at the visual flow and understand:
    What steps happen after they place an order
    How their payment is processed
    When their order gets shipped and delivered
    ✅So instead of just reading boring text, users see a flowchart — it's easier and faster to understand.
    User Selects Product → Adds to Cart → Makes Payment → Order Confirmed → Shipment in Process → Delivered.

    Usually, React Flow is used inside a page (like a "How it Works" section, or Admin Panel), not on the homepage.
    It's not for designing the whole website, but explaining processes inside it in a beautiful visual way.
    "React Flow helps users and admins visually understand the working, processes, or journeys inside your website or app."
