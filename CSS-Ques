What are Pseudo elements and Pseudo classes?
Pseudo-elements allows us to create items that do not normally exist in the document tree, for example ::after.

::before
::after
::first-letter

Pseudo-classes select regular elements but under certain conditions like when the user is hovering over the link.

:link
:visited
:hover
:active
:focus

Explain me Different Box Sizing Property?

Here's how it affects layout:

When using box-sizing: content-box, if you set a width of, say, 300px on an element and add 20px padding, the total width will be 320px (300px + 20px padding on each side).
When using box-sizing: border-box, if you set a width of 300px on an element with 20px padding, the total width will remain 300px. The padding will be included within the specified width.

6. Difference between grid and flex?
CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows. Grid layout is intended for larger-scale layouts which arenâ€™t linear in design.
Flexbox is largely a one-dimensional system (either in a column or a row). Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application.
