Basics - 
Version - The current ServiceNow release is Xanadu, released in Q4 2024. The next release, Yokohama, is scheduled for Q1 2025. ServiceNow releases two new versions each year. 


1.  What is ServiceNow? And why we use it.
A.  ServiceNow is a platform used to manage and automate workflows — like HR management, IT support, customer service, hotel management, etc.
    If we do not use it then - 
    In a company, employees need services too:
    Laptop not working? 🧑‍💻
    Need to apply leave? 🏖️
    Raise a complaint to HR? 📣
    Ask for software access? 🔐
    Instead of calling or emailing different departments, they just use ServiceNow — one place to request anything and track it live.

    Without ServiceNow:
    You work at a company. Your laptop breaks. You email the IT department. Someone replies after hours asking for more details. You reply again. Then it gets forwarded to the right person. Maybe it gets lost. You keep following up. It's chaotic, slow, and disorganized.

    With ServiceNow:
    You open a self-service portal and submit an IT ticket for your laptop issue.
    ServiceNow automatically routes it to the right IT team based on your issue.
    You get updates in real time (status: “In Progress,” “Assigned,” “Resolved”).
    The IT technician sees all necessary info (device, user history) in one place.
    When resolved, you get a notification and can give feedback.
    🔁All this is logged, tracked, and reportable.



2.  Common Terms - 
A.  Concept You Mentioned	                            Correct ServiceNow Term
        HR Management      	                      Application / Module (e.g., HRSD)
      Functionality Flow	                      Workflow / Flow Designer Flow
       Business Logic Path	                      Process / Business Rule / Flow

    🔁Analogy:
    Think of an Instance like a house. Inside the house:
    HR = one room (Application)
    ITSM = another room
    Flows = electrical wiring (Workflow logic)
    Users = the people living in it

    🏠Instance in Real-Life Terms:
    Think of a ServiceNow Instance like your own private office building:
    🏢The building (instance) is yours — no one else can enter unless you allow them.
    Inside that building, you can:
    Set up departments like HR, IT, Finance (apps/modules)
    Define how people work (workflows/processes)
    Decide who gets access to which rooms (roles/permissions)

    🧠In Simple Terms:
    A ServiceNow Instance is your own separate copy of the ServiceNow platform, where your organization can build, manage, and automate its internal processes.

    Service-Portal: This provide a User-friendly self service experience it is an advanced UI of ServiceNow platform which provide access to specific features by using differnet widgets which can be customized and developed by ServiceNow developes. In this users can search knowledge articles request for any service.
    Catalog: They can request something directly to service portal.
    Request: They can see there own request.

    Support Authentication by ServiceNow - 
    Local Database - In this user and password is saved in servicenow instance in realted user racket.
    SSO - In this user is authenticated with detail provided by identity provider. For ex - Okhta is identity provider.
    LDAP - In this user is authenticated by a lightweight directory account O auth 2.0 by clientID and secretID by servicenow to consumer.
    Digest Token - Encrypted Username and password in the form of token is also supported & that is digest token.
    Multi-Factor - In this authentication is done by OTP code provided by google authenticator.

    In this we are going to have ROLE-BASED ACCESS to protech sensitive data acc to role based.
    ITIL, ADMIN, KNOWLEDGE ADMIN, APPROVER.

          A form displays information from one record in a data table.
    Form Configuration - The fields and layouts of the form can be configured servicenow admins can perform this configuration overall you can change the form design with two different options one is form layout in which you can create new views new fields and aadjust the layout of the form visible for the users.
    Form Design - Which is kind of advanced way to create field and adjust design on the from. We can also select the views by a form designas well as you can configure the form layout by right click on title bar of the form where you canb see.



5.  Task Management.
A.  Task - A task is any record that can be assigned or completed by a User in serviceNow. Users create tasks that are notified as the tasks moves along a workflow. Tasks can be assigned to user OR user groups.

6.  Notification-
A.  OutBound Notification - When serviceNow sends notification & that is received by a user. 
    Ex - Incident is assign to a group then all group members receive a email notification about the assignment of the ticket in their Queue.
    InBound Notification - When users responds to the email receive OR create new email and send it to servicenow.  It can basically perform some action on the records of table.   
    Ex - User can mark email in your instance email address and serviceNow can process that email & create incident racket and populate the fields as per information mentioned in email notification.

   System Notification - It has basically three different sections for different modules.     
   Email - It has modules related to modules notifications.

   We can Create Notification-
   System Notification > Notification > Fill Form.
   For Testing a Notification - 
   Incident > Open
   To see a Notification - 
   emails > System Logs -> emails.



   UI Policies - allow you to make fields read-only, mandatory, or hidden based on specific conditions like the value of a field.-[ 4 ]

   Reports - Reports in ServiceNow help you see and understand your data in a visual way — like charts, tables, and graphs.
   Types of Reports - 
   Bars - Compare individual or aggregate scores across data dimensions.
   Pies and Donuts - Pies and Donuts show the proportions that make up a whole.
   Time series - Visualize data over time.
   Multidimensional reports - Visualize data using multiple dimensions.
   Scores - Visualize a single data point.
   Other - There are even more chart types to choose from.
             You use reports to answer questions like:
             How many incidents were created this month?
             Which team has the most tasks?
             What’s the average resolution time?

   Notification - A Notification in ServiceNow is used to automatically send emails when certain conditions are met — like a record is created, updated, or a specific field changes.
   There are three sections to configure in a Notification.
   When to send
   Who will receive
   What it will contain

   System Policy - System Policy in ServiceNow refers to rules that control how data behaves in the system — without writing complex code.
   These policies help enforce data consistency, control field behavior, and trigger events. Think of them as the “rules engine” for forms and records.
   1. Data Policies - Enforce rules on records at both UI and import levels.
                      Make fields mandatory, read-only, or hidden — even during data import (like CSV or API).
                     ✅Works on the server side and UI (if "Apply to UI" is checked).
   Ex - Make Short Description mandatory when Category is Inquiry.
   2. UI Policies - Control the behavior of form fields in the browser (client-side).
                    Make fields mandatory, read-only, or hidden, based on conditions.
                   ✅Works only in the UI/form — not during data import.
   Ex - When State = On Hold, make Assignment Group field read-only.
   3. UI Policy Actions - The actual actions (what to do) of a UI Policy.
                          Like: "Make field X read-only", "Show field Y", etc.
