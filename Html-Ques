• relative: Here the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document and positioned relative to its original/ normal position.
• initial: This resets the property to its default value.
• inherit: Here the element inherits or takes the property of its parent.
Code-[HTML]-
<h1>Absolute</h1>
<div class="absolute">
</div>
<h1>Relative</h1>
<div class="relative">
</div>

CSS- 
.absolute{
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
  background-color: purple;
  border: 5px solid black;
  position: absolute;
  top: 100px;

22. In how many ways you can display HTML elements?
inline: Using this we can display any block-level element as an inline element. The height and width attribute values of the element will not affect.
Ex - <p class="fi">First</p>
     <p class="fi">Second</p>

.fi{
  display: inline;
}

block: using this, we can display any inline element as a block-level element. 
Ex - <span>Aman</span>
     <span>Mishra</span>

span{
  display: block;
}

inline-block: This property is similar to inline, except by using the display as inline-block, we can actually format the element using height and width values.
Ex- <p class="fi">First</p>
    <p class="fi">Second</p>

.fi{
  display: inline-block;
}

Block-level elements:
<div>: A generic container used to group other elements.
<p>: Represents a paragraph of text.
<h1> - <h6>: Headings from largest (h1) to smallest (h6).
<ul>: Unordered list.
<ol>: Ordered list.
<li>: List item within a list.
<header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>: Structural elements for different parts of a webpage.
<form>: Used for creating forms to collect user input.

Inline-level elements:
<span>: A generic inline container often used for styling purposes.
<a>: Creates hyperlinks.
<strong>, <em>, <i>, <b>: Used for text emphasis (bold, italics).
<img>: Inserts images.
<input>: For various types of input fields in forms.

What is the difference between “display: none” and “visibility: hidden”?

<p class="fi">Second</p>

.fi{
  visibility: hidden;
}

Ex- <p class="fi">First</p>
    <p class="fi">Second</p>
.fi{
  display: none;
}
